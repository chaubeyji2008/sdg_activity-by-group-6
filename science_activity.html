Holi, the festival of colors. But, aren't we making the environment around us colourless just for the sake of playing Holi? We are using materials that take thousands of years
to get recycled. Today, I Maulik Chaturvedi and I Gitanjali Taneja the members of Group 6 are going to tell you how we can make this festival eco-friendly.

<p>1. SAVE MONEY AND ENVIRONMENT:This time don’t buy Holi colours from the market – one they are made using harmful chemicals, secondly, they come wrapped in plastic packaging that ends up going into our overflowing landfills or oceans.
The worrisome fact is that plastic is non-biodegradable in nature, as a result, it ends up remaining on the planet for more than 500 years.
<p>2. SAVE WATER:According to a report cited in CSR journal, India wastes as much water as the whole United Kingdom consumes in a year. As per the researchers, India is
facing the ‘worst water crisis in history’. So, this Holi be a conscious citizen and help save water wastage. Celebrate the festival in an eco-friendly manner.
<p>3. DITCH THE USE OF PICHKARIS AND BALLOONS:Water balloons are made of rubber and plastic, while Pichkaris are simply made using plastic alone. Our country landfills are already burdened with overflowing garbage,
this Holi we can switch to eco-friendly alternatives and ditch these traditional Holi accessories that create unnecessary garbage and waste plenty of water.
