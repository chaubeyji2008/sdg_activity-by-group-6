<body background="holi.jpg">
<p>Dear Diary</p>
<p>Today i am feeling very happy as i have celebrated holi with my Friends, Family, and Relatives in an ECO-Friendly manner and it was one of the best day for all of us. We had lot of fun.We used ECO-friendly colours to celebrate HOLI this time because firstly,the colours we buy from markets are made using harmful chemicals, . secondly, they come wrapped in plastic packaging that is very harmful for our environment.
My cousins didnt use any water ballons as they are made of rubber and plastic, I felt very proud of my little cousins because I was the one who encouraged them to celebrate an ECO-friendly holi. We also took care of water conservation, we didn't use any pichkaris as they are made of plastic and leads to unnecesarry wastage of water, we also took care that we only used the amount of water we wanted to and didn't waste any. We also didn't burn HOLIKA as it causes 30,000 bonfires every year and leads to deforestration.
By the end of the HOLI program, it looked as if a colorful tornado has passed by our society. I had a wonderful time this year celebrating an ECO-friendly holi. My family and I took a pledge to celebrate an ECO-Friendly HOLI every year instead of celebrating the traditional HOLI to save our environment and also encourage other people to celebrate ECO-friendly HOLI.</p>
